✅ Instructions on How to Run the Project
Open the project using Unity Hub with the correct Unity version (e.g., 2021.3.x or whichever version used).

Make sure all dependencies are installed (TextMeshPro, etc.).

Open the main scene (e.g., MainScene.unity) from the Scenes folder.

Click the Play button in the Unity Editor to run the game.

Brief Explanation of Design Choices
The game uses a 4-lane layout to match rhythm-style gameplay mechanics.

Two types of tiles are implemented:

Normal hit tiles (tap once to destroy)

Slide tiles (require the player to hold for a certain time)

Timing judgment is based on the tile’s position relative to the Judge Line, with feedback for "Perfect", "Great", "Good", and "Miss".

A simple UI Canvas is used to display score and hit feedback using TextMeshPro.
